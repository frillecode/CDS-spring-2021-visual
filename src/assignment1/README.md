# Assignment 1
The structure of the files belonging to this assignment is as follows:
  - Data: _../../data/assignment1/_  
  - Code: _basic\_image\_processing.ipynb_  
  - Results: _out/_  


### Cloning repo and installing dependencies 
To run the code in the notebook, I recommend cloning this repository and installing relevant dependencies in a virtual ennvironment:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/frillecode/CDS-spring-2021-visual.git
$ cd CDS-spring-2021-visual
$ bash ./create_venv.sh
````
If you run into issues with some libraries/modules not being installed correctly when creating the virtual environment, install these manually by running the following:  
```bash
$ cd CDS-spring-2021-visual
$ source frille-vis/bin/activate
$ pip install {module_name}
$ deactivate
```

### Running script
After updating the repo (see above), you can run the code in the notebook.
